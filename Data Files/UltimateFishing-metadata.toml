description = """\
Ultimate Fishing is a mod that adds a fishing skill and minigame to Morrowind.
- Equip lures and bait to your fishing rod, and catch over 20 different species of fish throughout Vvardenfell.
- Defeat each fish in a battle of wits and stamina. Ensure the tension doesn't get too low or too high, and tire the fish out before you run out of fatigue yourself.
- Fully animated fishing mechanics, including simulated line tension, player animations, and fish AI.
- Five legendary fish to catch. When harvesting a legendary fish, you will receive a trophy head that you can place on your wall
- Ashfall integration: bushcraft fishing poles, cook and eat the fish you catch
